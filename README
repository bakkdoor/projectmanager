Projectmanager is a simple web-based project management software. It's still in development.
Basically, I started working on it in october 2008 and didn't have time until now to continue development.
It does work somewhat already though and currently has the following features implemented:

   - Customer maintenance
   - Management of customer related projects, tasks and worktimes
   - Management Staff / Workers with different user roles.
   - Some minor statistical information etc.

There's more planned and help is always appreciated :)
If you want to help out, simply fork my repository and/or send me an email: bakkdoor@flasht.de

Theres a running sample at: http://projectmanager.flasht.de
A sample account you can use:
  login: test
  password: testing
Check it out to see a somewhat current version of it.

Currently the Display is german only, but I've planned to add some kind of localization to it, to
make it easy to support different languages.
The code however is mostly in english, especially all variable, methods and classes are in english, so
even if you don't understand the interface yet, you should be able to read the code pretty easily.

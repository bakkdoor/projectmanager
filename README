Projectmanager is a simple web-based project management software. It's still in development.
Basically, I started working on it in october 2008 and didn't have time until now to continue development.
It does work somewhat already though and currently has the following features implemented:

   - Customer maintenance
   - Management of customer related projects, tasks and worktimes
   - Management Staff / Workers with different user roles.
   - Some minor statistical information etc.

There's more planned and help is always appreciated :)
If you want to help out, simply fork my repository and/or send me an email: bakkdoor@flasht.de

Theres a running sample at: http://projectmanager.flasht.de
A sample account you can use:
  login: test
  password: testing
Check it out to see a somewhat current version of it.

Currently (as of version 0.2.0) the interface supports german and english, but since its using rails' I18n, adding additional languages should be easy. If you feel like helping out with translating into additional languages, feel free to contact me or start your own fork.
The code however is almost completely in english (except for some comments i haven't translated into english yet - I'll do that soon!), so it should be pretty easy to get along with the code. Any questions? Feel free to ask me :)
